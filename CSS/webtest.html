        <h2>Origin</h2>
        <p>Holbein watercolor originates from Japan. The company was founded in Osaka in 1900 by Mr. Jujiroh Holbein, who named the company after the famous Northern European artist Hans Holbein the Younger. Initially, the company produced pigments and colors for Japanese-style paintings, but later expanded to Western-style painting supplies. Today, Holbein watercolor paints are used by artists worldwide and are known for their high-quality pigments and smooth, consistent application.</p>

      <h4>Holbein Watercolor on Cold Press vs Hot Press Paper</h4>
    <p>When it comes to using Holbein watercolor paints, the choice of paper can greatly affect the final outcome of your artwork. Cold press paper has a slightly textured surface that works well for creating a range of effects, from smooth washes to more textured, grainy areas. This paper is a popular choice for watercolorists because it allows for a high level of control and versatility.</p>
    <p>In contrast, hot press paper has a much smoother surface that results in brighter and more vibrant colors. This paper is often used for detailed work or when a more polished finish is desired. However, it can be more difficult to work with than cold press paper because the paint tends to sit on top of the surface rather than being absorbed into the fibers.</p>
